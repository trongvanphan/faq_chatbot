- **Interact**: Encourage audience questions
- **Highlight**: Point out unique features and technical capabilities

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How does the system know which agent to use?"**
A: "The master orchestration agent uses Azure OpenAI to classify user intent based on keywords and context, then routes to the most appropriate specialized agent using LangGraph workflows."

**Q: "Can you add new car data?"**
A: "Absolutely! You can upload new JSON files through the Knowledge Base tab. The system will process and embed the new data automatically."

**Q: "How accurate are the recommendations?"**
